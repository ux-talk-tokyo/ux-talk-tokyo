Gengo offices 3-27-11, Yushin bldg 8F, Shibuya, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan 150-0002

The first meeting of UX Talk Tokyo, and Gengo have very kindly offered to host it.

The evening will start at 7pm with a discussion on "UX Process", then free time for networking until 9pm.

The spirit of the group is very inclusive. Some people will have a lot of UX knowledge, and others very little, but it doesn't matter. Everyone is welcome and any question is ok.

Places are limited, so please sign up early. If you reserve and then discover that you can't come, please cancel your ticket on Doorkeeper.
