Roy joins us from his agency, Rival Schools, to talk to us about his learnings on GV Design Sprints and applying them to his UX work.

*2) *Keeping Your Users in the Loop - A Breakdown of UI & UX in Pirate Pop Plus by Hawken King
Hawken King returns to UX Talk Tokyo for his second presentation about his adventures in the game industry. His newest title, Pirate Pop Plus, is making splashes in the gaming world and he's going to be sharing info about crafting the UX experience for it.

Then there will be networking until 9pm.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
