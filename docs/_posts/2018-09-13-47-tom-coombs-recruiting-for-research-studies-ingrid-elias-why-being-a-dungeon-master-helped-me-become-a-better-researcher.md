Before we start...
Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.

We are back for September and this time we are at Indeed MEGURO (NOT the Ebisu one, returning visitors!)
Indeed is kindly sponsoring the event, so it's FREE and there'll be pizza! (Thanks indeed!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

Tom Coombs - "Recruiting for Research Studies"
Tom will talk about methods for recruiting participants for research studies. He will share some early results of experiments done at LendStreet to evaluate Facebook ads as a recruitment tool. Tom is Co-founder / Head of Product at LendStreet Financial, a consumer lending company.

Ingrid Elias - “Why being a Dungeon Master helped me become a better researcher” (Presentation in English w/ some Japanese Subtitles)
Ingrid will be talking about how even a nerdy hobby like table top role playing can get you ready to tackle new challenges as a UX designer. Ingrid is a UX Designer at Goodpatch, Shibuya.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
