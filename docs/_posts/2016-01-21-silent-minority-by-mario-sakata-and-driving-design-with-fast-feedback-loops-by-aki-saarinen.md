EDIT: If you've had a cancellation email it's because we made a mistake with the limits of the event and we had to move some people to the waitlist. Apologies.

Happy New Year everyone! UXTalkTokyo is BACK!

There will be two presentations:
1) Silent Minority
Mario Kazumichi Sakata, UX Designer at Recruit Technologies, will be talking about how to gather insights from silent needs of customers in 5 simple steps, with his recent case studies and takeaways from IDEO U.

2) Driving design with fast feedback loops
Aki Saarinen from Reaktor (http://www.reaktor.com/) will talk about rapidly growing a userbase with a fast feedback loop in user experience design. Aki will present a case study of an online radio streaming application (http://www.radiot.fi), where the team used a very tight feedback loop to end-users via use of multi-channel feedback (in-app, social media, app stores, etc). Reaktor is a global creative product studio with offices in Tokyo, Finland and New York.

Presentations this month will both be in English with Japanese subtitles.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. This month we are back at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
