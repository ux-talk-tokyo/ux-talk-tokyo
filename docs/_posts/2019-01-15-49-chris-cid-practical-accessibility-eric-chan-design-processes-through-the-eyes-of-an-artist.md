Happy New Year everyone! 

Before we start, just wanted to mention that Udemy has a bunch of UX courses on sale for a lot cheaper than they usually go for! (This isn't an ad or endorsement, btw, just thought it might be interesting).<br>

There will be two presentations on the night:

<strong>Chris Cid: Practical Accessibility</strong> (ENG)<br>
Why do we need to care about Inclusive Design, A11Y, WCAG, WAI. ARIA and other cryptic terms? Chris, a Tokyo-based UX engineer, will explain the importance of accessible UX, UI and development in order to be able to provide inclusive design results for digital projects

<strong>Eric Chan: "Design Processes through the Eyes of an Artist"</strong> (ENG)<br>
How does design process / methodology work in the eyes of an artist? With the successful creation of the 100-foot (30.48 meter) mural for the Canada Science &amp; Technology Museum, Digital Artist Eric Chan a.k.a. EEPMON will go behind the scenes on this ambitious public project. [http://eepmon.com](http://eepmon.com)

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
