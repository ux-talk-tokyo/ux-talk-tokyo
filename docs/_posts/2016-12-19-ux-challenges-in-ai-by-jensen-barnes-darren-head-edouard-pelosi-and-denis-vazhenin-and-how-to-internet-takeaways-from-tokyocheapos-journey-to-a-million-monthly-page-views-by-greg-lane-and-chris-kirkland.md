IDEO Tokyo 5-4-35 Minami Aoyama, #201 Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-0062

Hi there, we are back for December, and this time at IDEO Tokyo (big thanks to IDEO!)

There will be two presentations on the night:<br>
1) "UX Challenges in AI" by Jensen Barnes, Darren Head, Edouard Pelosi and Denis Vazhenin"<br>
Two designers and two engineers from AIR at en-japan inc. share what theyâ€™ve learned and the UX challenges faced when building their new advanced tech product called Vibe. [https://vibe.work/](https://vibe.work/)

2) "How to Internet: Take-aways from TokyoCheapo's Journey to a Million Monthly Page Views" by Chris Kirkland and Greg Lane<br>
Longtime friends of the event, Chris and Greg from the popular site TokyoCheapo (.com) return to let us know their learnings they've had over the last year with TokyoCheapo, with some surprising finds along the way. 

Then there will be networking until 9pm.<br>
It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.

Like we mentioned, this month we are at IDEO Tokyo and it's a bit more intimate than previous months. Please ensure you have registered and have your ticket in some form on the day.
