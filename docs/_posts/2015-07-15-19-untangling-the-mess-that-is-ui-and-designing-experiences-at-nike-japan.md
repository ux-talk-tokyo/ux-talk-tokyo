Gengo, Shibuya 3-27-11, Yushin bldg 8F, Shibuya, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan 150-0002

UPDATE - We are WAY above capacity. If you aren't on the list, we are afraid it will not be possible to attend

We have two great presentations for you:
1) Johanne Ronse will be talking about untangling the mess that is native vs. web UI vs. all the platforms and guidelines that the vendors give you. Johan is a user interface designer. He runs Mono, a small company specializing in interface design.

2) Midori Yamazaki from Nike Japan will be talking about the methodologies used by Nike Japan to create their event experiences.

Presentations this month will both be in English.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. As usual it's at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
