UX Talk Tokyo is back (after three years, no less!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

Alan Roth: "Experimentation at Amazon"
Alan is the Head of Product for Alexa Japan. His talk will discuss improving CX by staying curious and rigorous experimentation.

Martin van der Linden: "The UX of physical space design"
Martin is a Dutch Architect who runs his own architectural practice in Tokyo. He will talk about his work designing corporate interiors and the methods his team use to design people's experience of physical spaces. Previously, as a researcher at Waseda University, he developed a methodology called "Work Vitamins" for translating corporate ethos into physical spaces.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group for anyone interested in UX. New people are most welcome and please plan to join the after party. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

Entry is ¥500 yen at the door. Free for students.

DIRECTIONS TO VENUE

From the station, exit A3, turn around, and walk along the tree-lined Omotesando Street. Pass CÉLINE and you’ll see the entrance to One Omotesando on the right-hand side. IDEO Tokyo is on the 7th floor.
