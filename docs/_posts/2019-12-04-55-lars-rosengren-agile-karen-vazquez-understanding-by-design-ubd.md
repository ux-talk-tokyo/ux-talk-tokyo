57 participants

Zehitomo Chiyoda Ichibancho Building 5F 23-3 Ichibancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0082

There will be two presentations on the night:

*<em>Lars Rosengren: "Doing Agile/Being Agile" *</em><br>
Lars will talk about why Agile is essential for digital innovation and yet why it sometimes brings us on the wrong path. <br>
He is a principal coach at Ustwo, helping companies and teams navigate change and become better equipped  as digital product and service organisations.

** Karen Vasquez - The UbD Framework **<br>
Karen will be talking about Understanding by Design (UbD) framework which is commonly used to design e-learning. The essence of this talk is "How do we make it more likely - by our design - that more users really understand what they are asked to learn?" To answer such question she will propose a helpful way to think about what understanding is, how to design for it, and how to find evidence of it in users' work. 

Karen is Learning Experience Designer at WGU Labs

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
