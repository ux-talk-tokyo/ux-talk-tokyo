At the next meeting there will be two talks:

• <strong>"Eye tracking testing for mobile devices"</strong> by Kanayama-san (aka "Toy-san")<br>

Then there will be free time for networking until 9pm, when our kind hosts [Gengo](http://gengo.com) will politely ask us to leave.

The spirit of the group is very inclusive. Anyone interested in UX is welcome, regardless of experience, and any question is ok.
