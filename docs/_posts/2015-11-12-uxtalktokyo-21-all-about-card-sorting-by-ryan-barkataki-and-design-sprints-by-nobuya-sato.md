<strong>DIFFERENT LOCATION FOR THIS MONTH!</strong> <em>(Check the map)</em><br>
今月はいつもと違う場所であります！（地図を見てください）

UXTalkTokyo is back to monthly service! Isn't that nice?

<strong>1) All About Card Sorting</strong> <br>
Ryan Barkataki, UX Director for the Japanese design agency <em>Up Arrows</em>, will be talking about this often overlooked method of UX Research, which is both low cost and useful. Up Arrows is a multi-disciplinary design agency based in Tokyo and Osaka. 

<strong>2) Design Sprints</strong><br>
Developed by Google Ventures (GV), Design Sprint is a 5-day intensive process for answering critical business questions using a Design Thinking approach. Google refined this GV’s design process into a more practical and tight way to compliment your ongoing project. Nobuya Sata will talk about the process.

Nobuya Sato is a Founder/UX Design Director of Secret Lab, Inc., an UX and Design strategy firm in Tokyo. He is also a Product Strategy Director at AKQA, an idea and innovation company. @nobsato 

Presentations are in English, but we should have some Japanese subtitles.

Afterwards, the usual networking until 9pm.

<strong>THIS MONTH WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE!</strong>

Our usual place is busy this month, so our good friends at Tacchi Studios have stepped in and saved the day for us (so big thanks to them)! Please look at the map for more information. 

Tacchi Studios are a design and development studio based in Shibuya. They are the team behind the awesome social networking service <em>Canvas</em> (canvas.co.com), the definitive list of creatives in Tokyo.  

UXTalkTokyo is an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
