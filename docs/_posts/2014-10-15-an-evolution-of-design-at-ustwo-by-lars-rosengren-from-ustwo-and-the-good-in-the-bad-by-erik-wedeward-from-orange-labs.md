There will be two presentations:

1) "From icons to product â€” an evolution of design at Ustwo"<br>
Lars Rosengren from UsTwo (London) will talk about how the perspective on design/UX has changed over the past few years. UsTwo is a fiercely independent digital product studio, based in London, Malmo, New York and Sydney. They do fun things like the games Whale Trail and Monument Valley, but they also serve a range corporate clients and more recently build and launch their own ventures.

2) "The good in the bad"<br>
Erik Wedeward will talk about how bad usability can lead to positive effects for the user. Erik works as a design researcher at Orange Labs Tokyo, a research and innovation office for Orange, the major European Telecoms company.

The presentations will be in English.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. As usual it's at [Gengo](http://gengo.com) (thanks Gengo). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
