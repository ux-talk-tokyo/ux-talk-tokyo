Hi, we are back for March and this time we are at Pivotal! (Thanks as always, Pivotal Labs!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

<strong>Arlon Roese : "Customer Success and Why it is Important"</strong> (ENG)<br>
Arlon will present a brief overview on what CSMs do and how they focus on the customer to set them up for success and why this is an important business strategy. Arlon is the CSM at Verizon. 

<strong>Canyon Boak: "Increasing Fidelity with Confidence"</strong> (ENG/JP subtitles)<br>
This presentation addresses how we can build up the fidelity of a design iteratively as we become more confident in the problems our users have, and the solutions we are testing with them. Canyon is a Product Designer at Pivotal Labs Tokyo.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
