Gengo offices 3-27-11, Yushin bldg 8F, Shibuya, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan 150-0002

There will be two presentations:

1) "Lean UX in Practice"<br>
Mark McFarlane will talk about real-life experiences of using lean UX methods on an app design and build project.

2) "Succeeding at Page speed"<br>
Chris Kirkland will share his experiences optimising page load speed, and the  measurable effect it has on conversation rates and bounce rates.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. As usual it's at [Gengo](http://gengo.com) (thanks Gengo). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
