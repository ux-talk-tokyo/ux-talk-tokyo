There will be two presentations:

1) "Crashing users' homes, drinking their tea"
Chris Palmieri will explain a user research technique called contextual inquiry, a fancy term for observing users doing stuff in their natural habitat. In a completely non-creepy way.

2) "Mobile UI Experiments to Improve UX"
Greg Lane, founder of Tokyo Cheapo will talk about some experiments to the interface of Tokyo Cheapo and the impact on user behaviour seen through the analytics data.

The presentations will be in English. There will be networking until 9pm.
