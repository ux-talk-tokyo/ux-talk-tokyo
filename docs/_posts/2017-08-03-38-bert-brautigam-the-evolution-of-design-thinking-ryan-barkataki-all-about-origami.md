Before we start...
Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.

We are back for August and this time we are at Goodpatch (There are two, so go to the one shown on the map!)
There will be two presentations on the night:

Bert Brautigam : "The Evolution of Design Thinking" ï¼ˆENG)
Bert will speak about the evolution of the design discipline and how Design thinking is challenged for its business relevance. Bert is the Design Strategist at Ziba Tokyo.

Ryan Barkataki : "All About Origami" (ENG w/ JP Subtitles)
UX Talk Tokyo's very own Ryan will give an overview and examples of FaceBook's free prototyping tool, Origami. Ryan is a UX and Industrial Designer, working at Sony Interactive Entertainment, Japan.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
