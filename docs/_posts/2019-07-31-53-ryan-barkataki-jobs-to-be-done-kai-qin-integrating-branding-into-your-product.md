<em>Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.</em> 

We are back for July and this time we are at <strong>Goodpatch</strong> (There are two, so go to the one shown on the map!)<br>
There will be two presentations on the night:

<strong>Ryan Barkataki : "Jobs to Be Done"</strong> ï¼ˆENG/JP)<br>
Recently, the JTBD framework has been gaining some traction to answer customer needs. Ryan will explain this methodology in this presentation. Ryan is a UX and Industrial Designer, currently working at Sony Japan. 

<strong>Kai Qin : "Design Process Tips: Integrating Branding into Your Product from the Start</strong> (ENG/JP)<br>
By integrating branding into our product design process early and effectively, we design an greater cohesive experience for the end user. Kai is a brand and product designer, currently working at Goodpatch Tokyo.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
