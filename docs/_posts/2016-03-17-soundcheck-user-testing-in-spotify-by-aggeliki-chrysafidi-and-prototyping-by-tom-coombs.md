UXTalkTokyo is BACK for March!

There will be two presentations:
1) Soundcheck: User Testing at Spotify by Aggeliki Chrysafidi.
UX Researcher extraordinaire, Aggeliki Chrysafidi joins us this month from Spotify NYC, where she is part of the internationally renowned design team. She'll be telling us about Soundcheck, their user testing methodology and how it works for them.

2) Focus on Prototyping
Tom Coombs, Head of Products at LendStreet, will be showing a few techniques for prototyping based around Sketch & Invision.

Presentations this month will be in English with Japanese subtitles.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. This month we are back at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
