UXTalkTokyo is BACK for July!

There will be two presentations:
1) Atomic Design by Tom Coombs
Tom will be talking about Atomic Design, a design philosophy that draws parallels between the elements of design and chemistry. Tom is both UX Talk Tokyo founder and co-founder at Lendstreet; a service designed to help consumers that are in financial distress manage their debt and rebuild credit.

2) Rapid Collaborative User Testing by Ryan Barkataki
Ryan will be talking about an extremely quick method his company uses to test, get feedback AND report to clients all in ONE DAY! Ryan is both a UX Talk Tokyo organiser and a design director at Up Arrows, a boutique Japanese UX and Industrial Design studio based in Shibakoen. (English with Japanese subtitles).

Then there will be networking until 9pm. This month we are back at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
