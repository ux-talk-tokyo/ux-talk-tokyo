Before we start...
Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.

Tickets for this event are free, thanks to Indeed's generous hosting. There will be pizza.

We are back for October and this time we are at Indeed MEGURO (NOT the Ebisu one, returning visitors!)
There will be two presentations on the night:

Tom Coombs - "Behaviour Modification"
Tom is the co-founder of LendStreet and a co-organiser of UXTalkTokyo. LendStreet a consumer lending platform helping people get out of debt. He will talk about techniques used to modify behaviour and how they can be put to good use, to help people achieve life goals.

Meghan Radke : "A Retrospective of My Old Design Process"
Meghan is a product designer for Pivotal Labs. She will be looking back at her design process from a year ago and looking at the knowledge she has gained since. She will be talking about how she feels about her older process and how it could be improved.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
