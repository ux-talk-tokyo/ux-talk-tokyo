Hi, we are back for July, and this time we are at beBit! (Thanks, beBit!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

*Kazuki Jin: "Don't hesitate, just say it! - Managing Design Feedback" * (Presentation in Japanese w/ English Subtitles)
Getting feedback from other designers is valuable and it's also nice to receive. However, what should you, as a designer, aim to get from your feedback from other designers? Based on his experience, Jin-san will talk about managing and understanding designer feedback. Jin-san is a UX Designer and Project Manager at Goodpatch, Shibuya.

*Julie Schiller: "A strengths-based approach to your UX career" * (Presentation in English)
Julie will be talking about how to focus on your areas of strength to unlock you UX superpowers and grow your UX career. Julie is a UX Research Manager at Google in California.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
