Pivotal, Roppongi Hills Mori Tower 20F Roppongi Hills Mori Tower 20F, 6-10-1 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 106-6120

Hi, we are back for September and this time we are at Pivotal! (Thanks as always, Pivotal Labs!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

*Bill Tribble - How to Win at Remote Work * (ENG w/ JP Subtitles)
Bill will talk about the pleasures and pitfalls of remote life - strategies for success, what to avoid, and how to find work online. Bill is a design team leader, UX consultant, and digital product designer based in Tokyo.

*Yukino Kohmoto - UX around machine learning * (ENG/JP)
Yukino will talk about what machine learning has been apparently changing around us and a potential role of UX designer in such changes. Yukino is a in-house designer based in Japan

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
