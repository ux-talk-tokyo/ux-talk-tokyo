It's time for UX Talk Tokyo #5 ...

The theme for the evening is FAILURE. If you missed the last session, you will have missed the interesting discussion afterwards where we discussed a few things that didn't work as planned. The session next week will focus entirely on those things.

There will be a series of very short (5 minute), informal talks, each sharing a story about something that didn't work out and why. Please let me know if you have a story you can share ... free UX therapy.

As usual it's at Gengo (thanks Gengo), and there will be networking afterwards until 9pm.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.

Places are limited, so please register early, and if you can't make it, please cancel on Doorkeeper.

Finally, the mailing list is at http://eepurl.com/BE70L if you or anyone you know would like to be informed of future events.
