38 participants

AQ 2-21-22 Nishi Azabu Minato-ku West Azabu 2F Tokyo, Japan 106-0031

<strong>Before we start...</strong><br>
<em>Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.</em> 

We are back for January and for the first time, we will be at AQ! (Thanks AQ!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

1) Majarc Anderson : UX for VR: Joys and Pitfalls, a 60 Day Journey

Majarc Anderson is the Lead UX Designer at startup PlusOne, Inc., where they are developing VR language learning and communication simulation/analytics software. Join Majarc as he goes through his findings about the nature of interactions in VR, hardware headaches, and glimpses of the future that he encountered during his first 60 days.

2) Jan Rod : Designing Custom Hardware Interfaces for the HTC Vive <br>
Jan will be looking at the design process, development tools and workflows needed to create experiences for the HTC Vive.<br>
Jan is the Design Lead at Telexistence Inc. [www.tx-inc.com](http://www.tx-inc.com)

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
