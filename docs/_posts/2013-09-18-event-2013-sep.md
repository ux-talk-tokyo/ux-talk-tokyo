The next exciting meeting of UX Talk Tokyo will take place in a couple of weeks. And again [Gengo](http://gengo.com) have kindly offered to host it.

The evening will start at 7pm with a discussion on "Startup UX", then there will be free time for networking until 9pm.

The topic will be prototyping. We'll have 4 short (ten minute) presentations on different prototyping tools.

The spirit of the group is very inclusive. Some people will have a lot of UX knowledge, and others very little, but it doesn't matter. Everyone is welcome and any question is ok.

Places are limited, so please sign up early. If you reserve and then discover that you can't come, please cancel your ticket on Doorkeeper.
