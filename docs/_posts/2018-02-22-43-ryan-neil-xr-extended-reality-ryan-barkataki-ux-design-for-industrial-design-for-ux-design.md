Before we start...
Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out.

We are back for February and this time we are at Indeed MEGURO (NOT the Ebisu one, returning visitors!)
This month is free thanks to our grand sponsor, indeed! (Thanks, as always, indeed!)
Did I also mention they are providing free pizza?

There will be two presentations on the night:

Ryan Neil: XR (extended reality) — A solution with its own set of problems
XR (extended reality), which encompasses VR, AR, MR, and any other _R, is a much needed solution for professionals in many different industries. However, XR comes with a set of unique problems that need to be addressed before XR can really gain mass appeal. Ryan Neil is the Brand Director at Symmetry.

Ryan Barkataki : "UX Design for Industrial Design for UX Design" (ENG w/ JP Subtitles)
UX Designers and Industrial Designers relationships are now closer than any other period in design history. This presentation aims to look at how the two disciplines learn from each other. Ryan is a UX and Industrial Designer, working at Sony Interactive, Japan.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
