UX Talk Tokyo is back (after three years, no less!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

Alan Roth: "Experimentation at Amazon"
Alan is the Head of Product for Alexa Japan. His talk will discuss improving CX by staying curious and rigorous experimentation.

Martin van der Linden: "The UX of physical space design"
Martin is a Dutch Architect who runs his own architectural practice in Tokyo. He will talk about his work designing corporate interiors and the methods his team use to design people's experience of physical spaces. Previously, as a researcher at Waseda University, he developed a methodology called "Work Vitamins" for translating corporate ethos into physical spaces.
