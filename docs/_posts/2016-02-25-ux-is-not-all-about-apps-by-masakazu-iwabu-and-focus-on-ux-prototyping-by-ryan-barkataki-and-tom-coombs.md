UXTalkTokyo is BACK for February!

There will be two presentations:
1) UX is not (all) about Apps by Masakazu Iwabu of DesignIt.
For decades, UX design has been associated with defining features and making screens. It’s about to change. Given the changing technological landscape and behaviours, UX designers need to think about systems, not apps; starting from the user and ending with touch-points, not the other way around.

2) Focus on Prototyping: Keynote and TBD
In the current UX industry, there are a huge amount of UX Prototyping Tools available for designers. Which ones should you use? In the first of a (semi) regular feature, Ryan from Up Arrows will explore prototyping in Keynote and Tom Coombs from LendStreet will explore another prototyping tool.

Presentations this month will be in English with Japanese subtitles.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. This month we are back at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
