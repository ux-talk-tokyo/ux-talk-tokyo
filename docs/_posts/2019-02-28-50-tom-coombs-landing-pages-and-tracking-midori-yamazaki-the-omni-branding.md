Hi everyone, back for February.

There will be two presentations on the night:

Tom Coombs - Landing Pages and Tracking (ENG)
Description coming soon.

Midori Yamazaki – The OMNI Branding (JP/ENG)
Midori will be talking about the OMNI Channel Branding that can tell brand story in the most effective way with premium experience. Midori is a Creative Director of Strategic Creative Room at Condé Nast Japan.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
