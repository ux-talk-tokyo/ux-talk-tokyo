"Why Should I Wear This? Human-centered Value Propositions for Wearables" by Mario Ruiz
This talk will take a human-centered design approach to evaluating and crafting value propositions, and then translating them into physical and digital prototypes for wearables.

Mario is part of Ignite, Salesforce's strategic human-centered innovation program. He has a BS in Product Design from Stanford University and a Master of Design Methods degree from the Institute of Design.

"Challenges in Qualitative Data Research" by Hiroyuki Shibata
When it comes to producing products in a company, a lot of the strategy and marketing is informed by the data received from qualitative research. Very often, you have to show correlations between research and business results. This presentation will cover the challenges that faces and examples of methods used for this.

Shibata-san is a long time supporter of UXTalkTokyo (and UX in general!) and works for Yahoo! Japan in the development of service products, and introducing user feedback to the design process.
