<strong>Before we start...</strong><br>
<em>Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.</em> 

We are back for June and this time we are at <strong>Indeed MEGURO</strong> (NOT the Ebisu one, returning visitors!)<br>
There will be two presentations on the night:

<strong>Aaron Kovalcsik: Using Sprints as a SuperPower</strong> <br>
Aaron will describe the Google Sprints Methodology and present a case study of how an international team leveraged it to road map a major global product. Aaron is a Senior UX Designer at Indeed, Tokyo. 

<strong>Ryan Ruel : "Designing Deliverables"</strong> <br>
Ryan will be talking about how to deliver great ideas to teams and organizations. Ryan is Creative Director at AQ in Tokyo.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
