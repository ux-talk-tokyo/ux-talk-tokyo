NinetyTwo13 by Tokyo Chapter Akasaka 9-2-13, Minato-ku Tokyo

<strong>Before we start...</strong><br>
<em>Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.</em> 

We are back for November and this time we are being hosted by <strong>NinetyTwo13</strong> by Tokyo Chapter (Thanks, Tokyo Chapter - [https://www.facebook.com/ninetytwo13/](https://www.facebook.com/ninetytwo13/) ) 

There will be two presentations on the night:

1) Alvaro Arregui : "Metabolist Mobility"<br>
Alvaro will outline a new subject; “Metabolist Mobility”, a design process for a circular economy in mobility by 2030.<br>
As design consultant in Tokyo, Alvaro has been helping automakers like Nissan to drive the vision for the company’s near future. Alvaro is the founder of Nuevo.Studio 

2) Chelsea Hostetter :  "Becoming an Ethical Designer"<br>
Beyond poorly-designed user interfaces, UX designers also must consider sustainability and ethics. Chelsea will be talking about some “dark patterns” in UX and her personal experience in becoming a more ethical designer. Chelsea works as a Senior UX Designer at Goodpatch. 

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
