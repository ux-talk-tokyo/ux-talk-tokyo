IDEO Tokyo 5-4-35 Minami Aoyama, #201 Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-0062

Before we start...
Just a message from the organisers - if you reserve a ticket and then can't attend, PLEASE cancel before 2pm on the event day, otherwise other people miss out. We really are trying to avoid changing to pre-pay, so please help us out here. Thanks.

We are back for May and this time we are at IDEO TOKYO! (Thanks again, as always, IDEO!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

Jan Rod: "Reflections on Present Discussions on the Future of UX Design"
Jan will reflect on current topics revolving around present, past and future of UX as field and challenges we, as designers, face in everyday practice. Jan is the Design Lead at Telexistence Inc. and a Senior Researcher @ Graduate School of Media Design, Keio University

Eric Chan : "Design Thinking & Strategy"
Eric will talk about his process of design crafting â€“ how one picks and adapts design thinking, through a holistic approach into different platforms. He will show this by example with his collaboration with fashion brand Canada Goose. Eric is Founder and Digital Artist at EEPMON. http://eepmon.com

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
