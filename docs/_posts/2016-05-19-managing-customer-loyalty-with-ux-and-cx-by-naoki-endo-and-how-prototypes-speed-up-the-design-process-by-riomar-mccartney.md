UXTalkTokyo is <strong>BACK</strong> for May!

There will be two presentations:<br>
<strong>1) Managing Customer Loyalty with UX and CX</strong> by Naoki Endo.<br>
Naoki Endo of BeBit will be talking about the relationship of UX and CX in relation to acquiring and keeping customers. 

<strong>2) How Prototypes Speed Up the Design Process</strong> by Riomar McCartney<br>
Rio will be talking about how a detailed prototype can speed up development, easily share visions, ideas and make a product more reliable when sending it to the development team.  

Presentations this month will be in English and Japanese with respective subtitles.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. This month we are back at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
