UXTalkTokyo is <strong>BACK</strong> for August!

There will be two presentations:<br>
<strong>1) From Brazil! CI&amp;T's UX process + Lean &amp; Agile enterprise development</strong> by Hiro Kawabuchi<br>
CI&amp;T is a global IT service company from Brazil helping digital initiatives of global enterprises such as Coca Cola, Google, Johnson&amp;Johnson, etc. Having done every project in agile since 2007, the over 2000 employees company is still growing. At UX Talk, CI&amp;T Japan members will introduce the latest UX process in enterprise agile that proceeds the actual development. Hiro is the Marketing and Comms guy at CI&amp;T and is a rather awesome bassist, too.

<strong>2) The UX of Horror</strong> by Chris Pruett<br>
Chris Pruett joins us from the USA, where he is the co-founder of Robot Invader, a game development studio in Silcon Valley, which released their first mystery/adventure game for VR, Dead Secret, last year. He is also the developer relations guy at Oculus, but most importantly for our event, Chris is a walking encyclopaedia of survival horror games and will be talking about the mechanics of games that get us scared! 

Then there will be networking until 9pm. This month we are back at Gengo (thanks, Gengo!). It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome.
