75 participants

IDEO Tokyo 7F One Omotesando, 3-5-29 Kita Aoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-0061

There will be two presentations on the night:

<strong>Adam Yukio Toda: "Liftoff - Going from Design to Product Launch"</strong><br>
Adam is a product designer and digital strategy director at Reaktor Japan.<br>
Launching a product has many unforeseen challenges and real-world constraints.  Adam will share how Reaktor’s multifunctional teams tackle these challenges to successfully bring design concepts to launch.

<strong>Dehui Chen: "Next Gen Social Networking"</strong><br>
Chen is a Senior Software Engineer at SBIBITS. He will talk about the problems users face on the social networking platforms currently, and propose a solution for it.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.

<strong>DIRECTIONS TO VENUE</strong>

From the station, exit A3, turn around, and walk along the tree-lined Omotesando Street. Pass CÉLINE and you’ll see the entrance to One Omotesando on the right-hand side. IDEO Tokyo is on the 7th floor.
