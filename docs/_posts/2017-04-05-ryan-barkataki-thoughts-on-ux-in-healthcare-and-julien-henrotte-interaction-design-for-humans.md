Hi, we are back for April and this time we are at Pivotal! (Thanks, Pivotal Labs!)

There will be two presentations on the night:

<strong>Ryan Barkataki - "Thoughts on UX in Healthcare</strong> (ENG w/ JP Subtitles)<br>
UX Talk Tokyo's Ryan finally wrapped up a long-term UX project in the world of healthcare in February this year, after four long years. He will share his observations and strategies for how the UX Industry can work with healthcare professionals. Ryan is a UX and Industrial Designer, currently working at Sony Interactive. 

<strong>Henrotte Julien - Interaction Design for Humans</strong> (ENG)<br>
From design to debugging, Julien will speak about the process they use at AIR for their interaction design and how to apply those little time savers for your next project. Julien is a Belgian fellow who works at AIR at en-japan inc as an engineer frontend / ux, after being a digital strategist in the fashion industry.

Then there will be networking until 9pm. And then the world famous nijikai (after party).

Registration closes at noon on the day of the event.

It's an open, inclusive group. Anyone interested in UX is welcome. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

We're always interested in hearing from people who'd like to give a presentation.
