'UX Talk Tokyo' is a meet-up discussion group for people interested in User Experience and User Interface design in the Tokyo region. Many of the people who attend are not UX or UI specialists. Many are from related disciplines (illustrators, software engineers etc) and others are from other fields, or studying. 

We try hard to make events welcoming for people who haven't been before, so please do come along and feel welcome.
